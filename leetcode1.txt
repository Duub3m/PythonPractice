Problem: Find Target Indices After Sorting Array
Difficulty: Easy

Description:
You are given an array of integers nums and a target integer target. First, sort the array in non-decreasing order, and then find the indices where the target appears in the sorted array. Return these indices as a list.

If the target does not appear in the array, return an empty list.

Example 1:

Input:

nums = [1, 2, 5, 2, 3]
target = 2
Output:

[1, 2]
Explanation:
After sorting, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 3, 5]. The target 2 appears at indices 1 and 2.

Example 2:

Input:

nums = [1, 2, 5, 2, 3]
target = 4
Output:

[]
Explanation:
After sorting, nums becomes [1, 2, 2, 3, 5]. The target 4 does not appear in the array.

Constraints:

1 <= len(nums) <= 100
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
-100 <= target <= 100
